As an accountant,
I want to accept a CSV with this month's Sales Data
So that I can calculate bonuses, net gains, and commissions

*Accepts a CSV with a header of 'last name' and 'gross_sale_value'
*If either of the CSV headers are omitted, CSV is not accepted

As an accountant,
I want to accept a CSV with employee information
So that I accurately calculate their payroll

*Accepts a CSV with the headers 'name', 'type', 'salary', 'commibonus', 'quota'
*If the headers are omitted, CSV is not accepted

As an accountant,
I want to calculate the gross monthly sales for the company
So that I can report the company's earnings

*Takes from the month's sales data csv
*Prints out the gross monthly sales for the company

As an accountant,
I want to output an employee sales report
So that I can report the sales of an individual employee for the month

*Calculates and displays an employees Gross Salary for the month, and their net pay once taxes have been deducted
*If an employee receives a bonus or a commission, outputs that as well
*If someone tries to look at the report of an employee that is not on the roster, they get an error message
